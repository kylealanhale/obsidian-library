# Obsidian Library View

## To do

### Bugs
* sometimes can't click on note preview if preview is short (handler on wrong elem?)
* selected folder isn't indicated
* vault folder isn't treated the same

### General
* column resizing
  * handle
  * commands, with width calculation to match non-doubled leaves
* âˆš better native style integration
* clean up preview copy
  * front matter
  * redundant title
  * markup (either plain text or simple rich text)
* drag and drop
* collapsed/selected state
  * unlink from stock file explorer
  * store selected note within folder
  * navigate to stored selected note or first note in list
  * better empty states
* note manual sorting

### Mobile
* mobile UI considerations
* rewrite UI in svelte/react? what's the mobile impact for that?
